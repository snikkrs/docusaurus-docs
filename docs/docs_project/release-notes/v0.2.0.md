## 🔒 Documentation Governance

### Frozen versions are now read-only

Starting with **v0.2.0**, all previously released documentation versions are considered **frozen**.

**What this means:**

- Past versions (for example `v0.1.0`) are **read-only**.
- Editing links are disabled for frozen versions.
- All new documentation changes must target **Unreleased**.

**Why this change?**

- Ensures historical accuracy.
- Prevents accidental changes to released docs.
- Aligns documentation lifecycle with product releases.

## 🧭 Impact

- No impact on content visibility.
- No impact on navigation.
- Improves long-term maintainability and trust in documentation.
